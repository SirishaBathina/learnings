Here are some common Kubernetes issues and their resolutions Part 1:

🚨 Issue: Pods in CrashLoopBackOff State
🔍 Cause: Application errors, missing configurations, or resources.
🔧 Resolution: Check pod logs using kubectl logs [pod-name] to identify the error. Ensure configurations are correct and resources (like memory and CPU) are properly allocated.

⚠️ Issue: Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) Stuck in Pending State
🔍 Cause: Insufficient storage or misconfigured StorageClass.
🔧 Resolution: Verify storage availability and ensure the StorageClass is correctly defined. Use kubectl describe pvc [pvc-name] for detailed error messages.

❗ Issue: Service Unreachable
🔍 Cause: Incorrect service configuration or network policies.
🔧 Resolution: Check the service and endpoint details with kubectl describe svc [service-name]. Ensure network policies allow traffic to the service.

⏳ Issue: High Pod Startup Latency
🔍 Cause: Resource constraints or node performance issues.
🔧 Resolution: Review resource requests and limits for pods. Consider increasing node resources or scaling the cluster.

🔄 Issue: Rolling Update Failures
🔍 Cause: Incompatible application versions or insufficient replicas.
🔧 Resolution: Ensure backward compatibility of new versions. Increase the number of replicas to maintain availability during updates.

🔍 Issue: Node Not Ready
🔍 Cause: Node resource exhaustion, network issues, or kubelet failure.
🔧 Resolution: Check node status with kubectl describe node [node-name]. Investigate kubelet logs and ensure node resources are sufficient.

🔧 Issue: Container Image Pull Errors
🔍 Cause: Incorrect image name, tag, or registry authentication issues.
🔧 Resolution: Verify the image name and tag. Ensure credentials for private registries are configured correctly in Kubernetes secrets.

📊 Issue: Metrics Server Not Working
🔍 Cause: Incorrect installation or configuration.
🔧 Resolution: Ensure the Metrics Server is deployed correctly. Check logs for errors using kubectl logs -n kube-system [metrics-server-pod].
